# Grover's Algorithm

# This repository contains the implementation of Grover's Algorithm using Qiskit. It is part of my internship at Computaex, where I am exploring quantum computing and unstructured search algorithms.


# Project Objectives:

# 1. Implement Grover's Algorithm in Qiskit.

# 2. Explore quantum advantage in searching unstructured databases.

# 3. Document the learning process and implementation steps.
